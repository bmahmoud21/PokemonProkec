# PokemonProkec

My idea for the project
-Interactive pokemon website
-Main pages displays hidden pokemon all around (ex: like in a field or something) on half the page
-and the other half page contains a pokedex
-Users then have to find all the pokemon that are hidden
-Every pokemon a user finds is added to their pokedex
-When the user finds a pokemon they have to click on it, which will then have a pokemon card looking item pop up with an img/gif of the pokemon and a summary of their backstory
-On the main page will only be un-evolved pokemon, as they will also be able to find hiden evolution stones to evolve a pokemon in their pokedex
-When they evolve a pokemon in their pokedex, the evolved pokemon will then be added to the main page and the process repeats
-The objective is to teach users about pokemon backstories / their plots in the shows
